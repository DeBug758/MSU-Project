# Class of Matrix on C++
In this project I realized a class of Matrix on C++ and some methods to work with it.

## What is realized?

* Class of Matrix with construcor, getters and setters
* Swap Cols/Rows functions
* Transposing, Inversing, Appending and Prepending
* Overriding of `+, -, *, /, %, =` operators (so you can, for example, add two matrix to each other just with operand)
* GaussJordan method
* Normalizing in two different ways (`norm1` and `norm2` fucntions)

## How to install and work with it?
Nothing special, just use (if you work on Unix like system) `gcc project.cpp` with `./a.out` or with your arguments.

If you wnat to test some methods, cases or just crash my code, write content in `main` fucntion.
